# Conference-Management-System
A python django project for conference management. There are chairs who can create new conferences, accept or reject submitted abstracts and papers and chairs can assign abstracts and papers to reviewers for them to review.
There are authors who can upload abstracts and papers and submit them to conferences. They get feedback from reviewers and update their papers accordingly.
There are reviewers whose duty should be obvious by now. 

Conferences have abstract submission deadline, paper submission deadline, review deadline, start date and end date. For example authors can't submit abstracts to conferences if abstract submissino deadline has passed.

All information about acceptance of papers or review assignments etc. are mailed to people who are concerned about that information.
